CONFIGURATION

Pianobar uses a configuration file. Under Windows this file is named pianobar.cfg
and should be placed in the same directory as pianobar.exe.
There is an example configuration file in the repository you can copy or rename.
Edit it and fill in the marked fields relevant to you, then remove or comment out
those remaining.

Note that non-US users have to have configuration file with control proxy
details set.


GLOBALPANDORA.COM

If you're behind proxy please look into pianobar.cfg.example and copy necessary
settings to your own configuration file. This are necessary, because
globalpandora.com does not support server used in by pianobar.
